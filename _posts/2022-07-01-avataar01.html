<p>This position brings challenges and rewards of being part of the initial SDR team at Avataar. You are required to be multidimensional, but the primary responsibility is to do market research, connect with customers through email\LI\phone, set up meetings, understand their pain points, and suggest solutions, with creative follow-ups leading to sales closure.

This position is an integral part of our sales engine and you will work directly with the co-founders to “hunt” for high-value opportunities. This collaboration makes this role unique and one of a kind in the industry.

The incumbent is expected to excel in this role and pave his/her own path to becoming a successful Account Executive in the next 18-24 months.

BDRs are focused on the front end of the sales cycle and are the face of Avataar. This individual must be a highly motivated, outgoing, self-starter who is able to identify and develop opportunities from multiple sources including prospect lists, and individual research.</p>
