<p>Our product doesn’t just increase or decrease things or cause people to be more productive. It transforms people’s lives and their work.</p>

<p>We need copy that reflects that ethos.</p>

<p>Copy that makes people feel something and causes them to act; not just click a link and be disappointed twenty seconds later. </p>

<p>But, really take action and change things around. Decide that the status quo doesn’t cut it anymore and adopt a new way.</p>

<p>Copy that connects at a visceral level. </p>

<p>Because, thinking is too much time. And thinking is often a post-hoc rationalization of what people feel, know, and want already. </p>

<p>So we don’t want to say we increase or decrease things or cause people to be more productive. We do more than that. </p>

<p>Can you help our prospects imagine a different reality?</p>
