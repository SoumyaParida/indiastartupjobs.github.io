<p>The world around us, as our eyes see it, is three dimensional. The world, however that we are shown via screens and use everyday to talk to our loved ones, work, shop and even entertain ourselves is almost unfairly still in two dimensions. Today, on the shoulders of giants, deep learning, computer vision, 3d graphics and computing horsepower have seen leaps like never before, and we believe the time to ubiquitously experience the world around us, in all the dimensions it has to offer is finally here!</p>
