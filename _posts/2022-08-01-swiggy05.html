<h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE TEAM & ROLE:</h2>
<p>The Marketplace Fulfilment Platform (MFP) team consists of Swiggy’s Core Logistics/Delivery, driver experience and CRM stacks. The charter of this team is to build a multi-tenant delivery platform that can seamlessly onboard multiple different businesses. The platform would need to maximise fleet efficiency across the various businesses. Additionally, the platform would allow third party Driver firms to onboard, while maintaining capacity across the various fleets, determine pSLA promises and assignment across various multi-modal fleets and support pluggable inclusion and exclusion rules to allow matching of orders to drivers. </p>

<p>The Driver Lifecycle Management (DLM) team is responsible for the solutions that meet the needs of the lakhs of driver partners that Swiggy has, including onboarding of drivers, contextual training, profiling, attrition prediction and intervention, governance modules, profiling and tiering and the base platforms for aggregation of signals, nudges to drivers to drive the right behaviors and low latency assistance flows to help the driver deal with exceptional scenarios that they may face in the order journey. The solutions created by the DLM team also need to be multi-tenant to support multiple business lines in Swiggy.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The driver experience team builds solutions across multiple domains including</h2>

<p><b>Sourcing and onboarding, Delivery Partner Entity and Lifecycle management</b> for our delivery partners to deliver a great DX while making sure, no one is able to abuse our platforms. </p>

<p><b>Contextual Training and Performance management platform</b> to help our delivery partners grow in their roles by nudging them in real time on what should / shouldn’t be done, which directly or indirectly affects their earnings. This platform also enables us to rollout gamification / experiments to keep DE’s engaged and help reduce DE attrition.</p>

<p><b>Profiling / Tiering platform</b> will build delivery partner segmentation across multiple attributes like tenure, rating, churn predictions, area familiarity, customer experience delivered, propensity to defraud / abuse the platform and more. Multiple products across Swiggy like Assignments, Mobilisation, Payouts will leverage these signals to solve complicated problems like what DEs to assign to a priority customer or to a customer who is on the verge of churning from the platform, what / how many de’s to mobilise across zones factoring in the conversion by segment, DE’s delivering a great customer experience are rewarded over and above, and more.  </p>

<p><b>Governance platform</b> to monitor all interactions between the DE and the customer, restaurant and Swiggy and act on the DEs basis rules configured either on some real time signals like abuse reported by a customer or aggregated data over time like x post pickup cancellations over a week. The actions taken can range from notifying the DEs on potential actions that can be taken to imposing monetary penalties to terminating them from the platform. Another challenge in this problem domain is to solve for attribution that is to reduce the false positives while providing strong redressal mechanisms.</p>

<p><b>Assistance platform</b> for our delivery partners to get their queries resolved in real time, enabling our delivery partners to deliver a great customer experience.</p>

<p><b>Forecasting and Mobilization</b> We take in demand (number of orders) predictions for a city, zone, time slot and build products to mobilize (delivery partner) supply on the ground. These include products that solve for long term mobilization (Hiring, Hiring Freeze), medium term mobilization (Slot Signup, Slot Tracker, Slot Compliance) and immediate mobilization (Dynamic Surges, Rain Surges, Nudges/Communication). Under supply and over supply are both equally bad for our business and hence the challenge here is accuracy and how quickly are we able to react to on ground situations (delta in demand and supply).</p>
