<h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE TEAM & ROLE:</h2>
<p>Trust and safety deals with a set of business practices whereby an online platform reduces the risk that users will be exposed to harm, fraud, or other behaviors that are outside community guidelines. Trust and safety capabilities are embedded into the core of the business to help build platform trust, protect users and create safe user experiences. </p>

<p>The Trust and Safety engineering team builds platform capabilities which tackle fraud and abuse problems affecting multiple verticals in the swiggy ecosystem (Customers, Restaurants, Delivery agents, store owners). We leverage machine learning models, rule engine capabilities, graph mapping, anomaly models and more to identify and take action on fraudulent behaviors.</p>

<p>Evolving beyond just fraud prevention, trust and safety is now a business-critical discipline for building a culture of care, protection and positive experiences for all parties interacting with a swiggy’s platform or services.

Think about Trust and Safety as a wide horizontal layer that builds engines, capabilities and platforms powering trust for every domain in Swiggy. This will eventually build into a generic SaaS layer which can be consumed by anyone in the Hyperlocal domain.</p>
