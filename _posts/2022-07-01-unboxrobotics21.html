<p>We at Unbox Robotics are revolutionizing warehouses and distribution centers by building the world's most compact, powerful, and flexible mobile robotics systems for the new age of warehousing.  Our product is the World's 1st of its kind AI-powered parcel sorting robotic system that gets installed 10X faster, saves 50+% space and improves productivity by more than 3X with 50% fewer robots than that of the competition. Founded in 2019, we are backed by marquee investors and angels. We are looking to add to our team of thinkers, innovators and doers and would love to have you join us at the Pune, India office and build the future of on-demand robotics logistics solutions</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Purpose:</h2>
<p>Systems Engineering is a cross-functional engineering team that is responsible for planning and execution of design and development processes. This team will work along with hardware and software teams to generate the system level requirements. Systems engineering team is also responsible to plan and execute integration and testing activities to ensure that the systems meet the performance metrics.</p>

<p>In this team you will be working with various systems and subsystems like sensing and actuation systems that would be critical in the robots and robotic systems for automating the warehouse operations.</p>
