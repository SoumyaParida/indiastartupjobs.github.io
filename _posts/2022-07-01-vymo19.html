<p>Vymo (https://www.getvymo.com) is one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in the world with the mission to help sales teams #DoMore. It’s a mobile-first Personal Sales Assistant -  a first of its kind - that automatically captures sales activities and predicts ‘next best actions’ contextually by learning from top sales reps. Headquartered in San Francisco, the company houses over 200+ people across 7 offices globally. </p>

<p>Vymo is trusted by over 100,000 users across 60+ leading enterprises such as AXA, Allianz, Generali, AIA, and more. A Gartner ‘Cool Vendor’, Vymo is funded by Emergence Capital & Sequoia Capital.

<h2 class="section-heading">What is the Personal Sales Assistant A game-changer!</h2>

<p>We thrive in the CRM space where every company is struggling to deliver meaningful engagement to their Sales teams and IT systems. But even the best CRMs have an adoption rate of less than 30%. Vymo was engineered with a mobile-first philosophy to help field sales teams operate more efficiently in a deskless environment. The platform through AI/ML detects, predicts, and learns how to make Sales Representatives more productive through nudges and suggestions on a mobile device. That’s why over 85% of salespeople use Vymo daily. </p>
