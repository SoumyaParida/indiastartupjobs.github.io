<p>Vymo (https://www.getvymo.com) is one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in the world with the mission to help sales teams #DoMore. It’s a mobile-first Personal Sales Assistant -  a first of its kind - that automatically captures sales activities and predicts ‘next best actions’ contextually by learning from top sales reps. Headquartered in San Francisco, the company houses over 200+ people across 7 offices globally. </p>

The company has seen 3x YoY growth over the last few years and aspires to do even better this year by building up the team globally.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is the Personal Sales Assistant A game-changer! </h2>

<p>We thrive in the CRM space where every company is struggling to deliver meaningful engagement to their Sales teams and IT systems. But even the best CRMs have an adoption rate of less than 30%. Vymo was engineered with a mobile-first philosophy to help field sales teams operate more efficiently in a deskless environment. The platform through AI/ML detects, predicts, and learns how to make Sales Representatives more productive through nudges and suggestions on a mobile device. That’s why over 85% of salespeople use Vymo daily. </p>
