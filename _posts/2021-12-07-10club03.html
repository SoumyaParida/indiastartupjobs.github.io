<p>This role is for an experienced professional, willing to take a seat on the rocket ship that has already launched. We are an e-commerce brand acquirer, and all our operations are focused on marketplace first businesses. The candidate selected for this role will work to ensure our companyâ€™s portfolio brands are growing aggressively and out do industry benchmarks and achieve what we would call explosive growth. This is a demanding role but since you are still reading this job description, we have concluded you love a good challenge!</p>

<p>This journey is all about taking our acquired brand from 1x to 10x in 36 months, while maintaining healthy margins. The acquisition happens at the very beginning of their boom, so a strong empathy towards the sellers and an ability to work through the chaos of their early build is a very important aspect of this role.</p>
