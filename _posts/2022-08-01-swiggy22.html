<h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE TEAM & ROLE:</h2>

<p>The Marketplace Fulfillment Team is responsible for the entire post order experience at Swiggy. The team consists of Core Logistics, Driver experience charter and solutions to enable and power our Customer Service agents with the Agent Workbench, Chatbots and Live Tracking screen for Customers and Agents.</p>

<p>Within the Marketplace fulfillment team, the Service Recovery team is responsible for detecting deviations from expectations during the order fulfillment journey, in real-time, and taking corrective actions to recover through best possible actions. Say if an order has not been assigned for N minutes and that order is at risk of getting delayed - the system then looks at reasons for delay and can potentially prioritize this order for assignment; alternatively, it can also detect that there are no Delivery Executives in the vicinity and can reach out to customers proactively informing them of the delay. Service recovery thus proactively monitors thousands of orders in real time and detects any issues to take proactive measures for recovery. Additionally, Service Recovery also looks at customer experience across multiple orders (historically) to determine if there are opportunities to improve the overall Swiggy experience for the customer.</p>
