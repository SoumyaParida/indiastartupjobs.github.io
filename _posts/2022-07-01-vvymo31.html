<h2 class="section-heading">About Vymo: Who we are, What we do</h2>

<p>Vymo is among the fastest growing enterprise SaaS startups in the world. In plain speak, our deal sizes are in 6 or 7 figures and what we do isn‚Äôt just convenient, it is critical to our customers. </p>

<p>For instance, if you turn off Vymo for a day - you halt business as usual for Asia‚Äôs largest Insurer, the 12th largest bank in the world, and 60 other large enterprises that depend on Vymo to enable salespeople and delight customers.</p>

<p>Customers don‚Äôt just buy our products off the shelf. It isn‚Äôt a see-click-buy-use experience, but a consult-solution-contract-deploy experience with significant investment from both sides. Our destinies are tied inextricably.  </p>

<p>And with great power comes great responsibility. So, we don‚Äôt just hire people who can hack, break, or ship, we hire folks who can tinker, iterate, and solve meaningfully for our customers. And also, for us. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Who we hire: Who is likely to succeed here</h2>

<p>Our best hires are,</p>
<ul>
	<li>not looking for a new job, but a new challenge </li>
	<li>unafraid to start from scratch and learn things</li>
	<li>empathetic and kind to customers & colleagues</li>
</ul>

<p>They also likely, </p>

<ul>
	<li>have started stuff (startups, projects, communities) </li>
	<li>are living their passion (code, design, marketing), and</li>
	<li>have a well thought out perspective on their work </li>
</ul>

<p>If that sounds like you, then we should talk. </p>

<p>NOTE: we love interesting conversations with passionate people, but we also won‚Äôt string you along for months on end. It‚Äôs either a HELL YES or a no from us. ++ You can expect cakes and cookies in the mail.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">About the role: Head of Creative - Brand Design</h2>

<p>The ‚ÄòHead of Creative‚Äô role was conceived to help us engage with prospects and customers more meaningfully across mediums.</p>

<p>It will generally involve working with designers, animators, copywriters, and growth marketers to solve a stated problem like, </p>

<ul>
	<li><b>How can we accelerate sales opportunities</b> (they need us, they love us, but how can we get them off their behinds to use us)?</li>
	<li><b>How can we increase adoption for Vymo</b> (how can we communicate to people who have always viewed tech with suspicion)?</li>
	<li><b>How do we increase conversions on campaigns</b> (are we saying the right things well enough to move CXOs to action)?</li>
	<li><b>How can we hire the best engineers</b> (inspiring love for the kind of work we do and who we are without offering BMW bikes)?</li>
	<li><b>How can we fight fatigue and burnout</b> (engaging 300+ people remotely and recreating the visceral energy of the office floor)? </li>
</ul>

<p>You get the drift.</p>

<p>We believe putting shapes and figures together on a beautiful, compelling interface is the lowest resolution of a design solution, much less a creative one. </p>

<p>We like Alchemy.</p>

<p>That is Part I. </p>

<p>The second, and wholly important part is marshalling the people and resources at your disposal to create this alchemy.</p>

<p>You will have to, </p>

<ul>
	<li>Work with Growth, Customer Success, HR, and other teams to align their operational requirements into something more strategic. Nobody just needs banners.</li>
	<li>Define the vision for your team and help them do the best work of their life. This involves getting rid of ambiguity,  and investing in their growth.</li>
	<li>Discover our brand ground up and figure how to best represent us. This will involve actually understanding users, customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Translate our brand values and aesthetics to EVERYTHING. Processes, templates, guidelines, workshops and whatever else is required to make sure we‚Äôre pixel perfect.</li>
	<li>Help the function evolve from support to strategy. That means defining work proactively for your team and function, building for scale and moving the needle.</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, but what will I build?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Design language & systems: that can help the team ship high quality work in a predictable way while striving for truly global benchmarks. </li>
	<li>Product marketing collateral: decks, docs, web pages, films explaining our value proposition to diverse audiences across 6 different geographies </li>
	<li>Brand communication: communicating Vymo‚Äôs values via different mediums to customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does all of this sound way too exciting for a B2B company? </p>

<p>A B2B Company </p>

<p>That‚Äôs because we are NOT a conventional B2B company. Over the last 7 years, we have reinvented every B2B tenet worth revisiting, including and not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enterprise software is not built for user love: our daily adoption is 2.5x average</li>
	<li>Cannot close 7 figure deals out of India: we have large customers in 6 countries</li>
	<li>B2B marketing is about decks & booths: we make art, films, and craft experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, we don‚Äôt consider Design or Creative a support function. We believe Creative is integral to crafting experiences that move people to action. </p>

<p>Because, even B2B companies work with people. </p>

<p>You have to work harder to understand our context. It may not be as simple as understanding why people buy sugary drinks or suits and ties. But, decisions are made by people with flesh and blood, and not insular, inanimate organizations. </p>

<p>Solve higher-order problems. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Is this right for you? Let‚Äôs see... </h2>

<p>We don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre right for everyone. We have made enough mistakes to understand what works for us and most importantly, what doesn‚Äôt. </p>

<p>If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs because your profile reflects the qualities we see in a potential hire. We‚Äôre approaching this role purely as an outbound activity.</p>

<p>You must necessarily have,</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>6-10 years of experience</b> leading Creative teams </li>
	<li><b>strong design fundamentals</b> across mediums </li>
	<li><b>built teams, processes, and brands</b> from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>If that‚Äôs not you, then we apologize for wasting your time. üôèüèΩ</p>

<p>Also, we need someone with a strong perspective, but you must marry that with the necessary curiosity and humility to discover our brand and do what‚Äôs right for us. We don‚Äôt want you transposing what you‚Äôve done before in our context.</p>

<p>Further, you must want to,</p>

<ul>
	<li>really understand our product and market, even the ‚Äúboring‚Äù bits </li>
	<li>be a manager and coach and set the north star for our people </li>
	<li>commit to a five year journey from hereon to IPO and beyond </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not in that mindspace right now then this won‚Äôt work out.</p>

<p>You can‚Äôt want this passively. It will have to consume you.</p>

<p>You will be spending a significant portion of your waking hours thinking about our mission. You will have to obsess about what we can do better each day.</p>

<p>We understand that this kind of commitment doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, but you must be willing to invest in the process at least. Because, we will. 100%.</p>
