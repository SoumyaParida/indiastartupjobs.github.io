<p>Pepper (www.peppercontent.in) is building India’s largest content marketplace that brings companies and content creators together to scale up content creation processes across 10 content verticals and 150+ content categories, 40+ content verticals, and 40+ global languages.

We have over 30,000+ writers and graphic designers who have applied to Pepper so far, who form part of the ‘Pepper Cloud’.</p>
<p>We are on the path to building a global on-demand content marketplace platform that allows for collaboration, discovery and upskilling for all our creators.

<p>We’re looking for someone who is enthusiastic, comfortable with uncertainty, flexible, great with people, understands our technical vision, and isn’t afraid to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. Every day is an opportunity to bring your vision to life, and to expand, learn, and grow. No idea is left unconsidered. No voice is left unheard.</p>

<p>We are looking at getting someone to manage the language segment at Pepper and scale the vertical from scratch. This would involve setting up a network of creators, reviewers, and editorial individuals for all prominent Indian languages and global languages. This would involve strong interpersonal communication skills and the drive of ‘Getting work done!’</p>
