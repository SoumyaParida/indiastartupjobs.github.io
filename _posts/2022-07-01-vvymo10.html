<h2 class="section-heading">About Vymo</h2>

<p>Vymo (https://www.getvymo.com) is one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in the world with the mission to help sales teams #DoMore. It’s a mobile-first Personal Sales Assistant -  a first of its kind - that automatically captures sales activities and predicts ‘next best actions’ contextually by learning from top sales reps. Headquartered in San Francisco, the company houses over 200+ people across seven offices globally. </p>

<p>Vymo is the distribution excellence cloud trusted by over 125,000 users across 60+ leading enterprises such as AXA, Allianz, Generali, AIA, and more. A Gartner ‘Cool Vendor’, Vymo is funded by Emergence Capital & Sequoia Capital. The company has seen 3X YoY growth over the last few years and aspires to do even better this year by building a truly diverse and global team.</p>

<p>We thrive in the CRM space where every company struggles to deliver meaningful engagement & contextual analytics to their Sales teams. But even the best CRMs in the world have an adoption rate of less than 30%. Vymo was engineered with a mobile-first philosophy to help remote sales teams operate more efficiently in a deskless environment. With its powerful intelligence engine, the platform captures sales activities automatically and learns how to make Sales Representatives more productive through nudges and suggestions on a mobile device. That’s why Vymo has an adoption rate of over 85%. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">About Creative @ Vymo: </h2>

<p>Creative @Vymo is an environment where design and business are codependent on each other. We craft innovations residing at the intersection of ‘desirability for customers’, ‘viability at the business level’, and ‘feasibility with respect to technology’. We study ethnography, behaviour, motivations, habits, and needs of who we are designing for, to drive our creative directions. We religiously believe in the creative process and prefer to remain outcome agnostic.</p>
