<h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE TEAM</h2>
<p>The Applied Research (AR) team at Swiggy focuses on long term projects around Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Speech Technology. We are looking for experienced researchers with an aptitude to solve challenging real-world problems in these areas. We are interested in practitioners and researchers with impressive problem-solving skills to solve challenging industry problems in the Foodtech and Hyper local spaces.</p>

<p><b>Role: Research Scientist (RS1 or RS2) in NLP</b></p>

<p>We are looking for a Subject Matter Expert in NLP, who would be working on some of the important problem statements we are trying to solve such as: intent classification, response generation, name entity recognition (NER) etc for developing a real time customer facing free-text chatbot; combination of classical ML techniques and text embeddings for text and call analysis of code-mixed data for down-stream use cases like fraud detection; sentiment analysis for understanding voice of customer and so on. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What do we look for?</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The potential candidates need to be well versed in classical NLP methodologies like tf-idf, language modelling, conditional random field  (CRF), topic modeling, word2vec, GloVe, fastText etc.	</li>
	<li>Good understanding of usual machine learning (ML) tools is very important.	</li>
	<li>Hands-on experience of current deep learning (DL) models/techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long-term short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), RoBERTa, GPT etc used for text processing and text generation is essential.</li>
	<li>Hands-on coding experience in ML friendly languages like python and knowledge of open source ML/DL libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch etc is needed in order to implement the ideas into working proof-of- concepts (PoCs) followed by deployment at scale.</li>
	<li>Experience of working with scalable systems is extremely desirable.</li>
	<li>The right candidate will have a Masters (M.S./M.Tech. etc) or/and PhD degrees with research experience of 2+ years in NLP  or related field with an aptitude for research.</li>
	<li>Preferably should have published their research in conferences and journals of repute. </li>
	<li>Cross-domain knowledge of fields like Speech will be an added advantage.</li>
</ul>
