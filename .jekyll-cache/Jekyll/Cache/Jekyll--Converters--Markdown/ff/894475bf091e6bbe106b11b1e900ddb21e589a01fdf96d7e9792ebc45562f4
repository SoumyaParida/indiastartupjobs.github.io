<p>We are on the path to building a global on-demand content marketplace platform that allows for collaboration, discovery and upskilling for all our creators. Now we are in a rapid expansion phase to enter into more content service offerings, engage a wide spectrum of content creators and at the same time, scale up our existing services.</p>
<p>Our focus is to make sure we have the right set of people delivering what we promise. People who obsess over operations, focus on the details and lead change by being curious, incisive, and courageous in everything they doâ€”on a foundation of unyielding integrity.</p>
