<p>The Marketplace Fulfilment Team is responsible for the entire post-order experience at Swiggy. The technology solutions built by Marketplace Fulfilment Platform (MFP) Team are at the heart of Swiggyâ€™s ability to deliver food to Customers. These systems power and affect the entire journey of a customerâ€™s order; from predicting SLAs for a given set of restaurants using AI models when the app is opened, to the time the order is delivered to the Customerâ€™s doorstep. The teamâ€™s charter encompasses all aspects of order fulfilment &amp; logistics, from planning the delivery fleet within a city/zone by time of day, to sophisticated algorithms and ML models that assign orders within minutes, in order to deliver the order within a 30-45min time slot, while maximising utilisation and efficiency of the fleet, to monitoring the order and automating interventions to handle exceptional conditions.</p>
