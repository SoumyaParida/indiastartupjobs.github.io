I"<h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE TEAM &amp; ROLE:</h2>
<p>The Driver App team develops the interfaces &amp; features for our delivery partners, enabling us to handle orders across multiple product lines - Stores, Food, Genie, Instamart, Liquor etc. Creating a smooth user experience for Swiggy Drivers, while ensuring compliance is always an interesting problem to solve. For example, during COVID-19, we introduced a daily selfie check, which internally uses a machine learning model to verify and ensure that our delivery partners are always wearing a mask. We also added some fraud checks lately, which saved us $2.2 million. </p>
