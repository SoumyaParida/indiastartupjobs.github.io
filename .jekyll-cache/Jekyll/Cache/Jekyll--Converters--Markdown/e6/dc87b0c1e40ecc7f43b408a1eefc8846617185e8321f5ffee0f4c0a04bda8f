I"B<p>Pepper (www.peppercontent.in) is building India’s largest content marketplace that brings companies and content creators together to scale up content creation processes across 10 content verticals and 150+ content categories, 40+ content verticals, and 40+ global languages. Over the past 3 years, we’ve worked with brands like Adobe, upGrad, Swiggy, Dunzo, BusinessWorld, Digit, Shiksha.com, Rapido, BookMyShow, UrbanClap, Yatra, Bewakoof, YourStory, Bharat Matrimony, and 300+ other brands. We have over 30,000+ writers and graphic designers who have applied to Pepper so far, who form part of the ‘Pepper Cloud’.</p>
<p>We are on the path to building a global on-demand content marketplace platform that allows for collaboration, discovery and upskilling for all our creators. Now we are in a rapid expansion phase to enter into more content service offerings, engage a wide spectrum of content creators and at the same time, scale up our existing services. </p>
<p>We’re looking for someone who is enthusiastic, comfortable with uncertainty, flexible, great with people, understands our technical vision, and isn’t afraid to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. Every day is an opportunity to bring your vision to life, and to expand, learn, and grow. No idea is left unconsidered. No voice is left unheard.</p>
<p>The supply marketing role is key to establishing and communicating a clear presence and value proposition to the creators we want to work with. It is key to the success of building the “right kind of supply” by attracting and resonating with them.</p>
