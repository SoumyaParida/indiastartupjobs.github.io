	<h2 class="section-heading">ABOUT THE TEAM & ROLE:</h2>
<p>Trust & Safety charter focuses on reducing the risk that users will be exposed to harm, fraud, or other behaviors outside community guidelines. T&S builds horizontal platform capabilities that are embedded in the core of the business to help build platform trust, protect users and create safe user experiences. The T&S Engineering team builds multi-tenant platform capabilities which tackle fraud and abuse problems affecting multiple verticals in the Swiggy ecosystem (Customers, Restaurants, Delivery agents, etc). We leverage machine learning models, rule engine capabilities, graph mapping, anomaly models and more to identify and take action on fraudulent behaviors. The challenging and interesting part of the charter is to be able to quickly adapt and mitigate emerging fraud patterns, while building the long term capabilities that would help prevent, detect and action fraud/abuse systemically.</p>
