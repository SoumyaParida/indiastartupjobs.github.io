It’s either a HELL YES or a no from us. ++ You can expect cakes and cookies in the mail.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">About the role: Head of Creative - Brand Design</h2>\n\n<p>The ‘Head of Creative’ role was conceived to help us engage with prospects and customers more meaningfully across mediums.</p>\n\n<p>It will generally involve working with designers, animators, copywriters, and growth marketers to solve a stated problem like, </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>How can we accelerate sales opportunities</b> (they need us, they love us, but how can we get them off their behinds to use us)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How can we increase adoption for Vymo</b> (how can we communicate to people who have always viewed tech with suspicion)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How do we increase conversions on campaigns</b> (are we saying the right things well enough to move CXOs to action)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How can we hire the best engineers</b> (inspiring love for the kind of work we do and who we are without offering BMW bikes)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How can we fight fatigue and burnout</b> (engaging 300+ people remotely and recreating the visceral energy of the office floor)? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>We believe putting shapes and figures together on a beautiful, compelling interface is the lowest resolution of a design solution, much less a creative one. </p>\n\n<p>We like Alchemy.</p>\n\n<p>That is Part I. </p>\n\n<p>The second, and wholly important part is marshalling the people and resources at your disposal to create this alchemy.</p>\n\n<p>You will have to, </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Work with Growth, Customer Success, HR, and other teams to align their operational requirements into something more strategic. Nobody just needs banners.</li>\n\t<li>Define the vision for your team and help them do the best work of their life. This involves getting rid of ambiguity,  and investing in their growth.</li>\n\t<li>Discover our brand ground up and figure how to best represent us. This will involve actually understanding users, customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Translate our brand values and aesthetics to EVERYTHING. Processes, templates, guidelines, workshops and whatever else is required to make sure we’re pixel perfect.</li>\n\t<li>Help the function evolve from support to strategy. That means defining work proactively for your team and function, building for scale and moving the needle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OK, but what will I build?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Design language & systems: that can help the team ship high quality work in a predictable way while striving for truly global benchmarks. </li>\n\t<li>Product marketing collateral: decks, docs, web pages, films explaining our value proposition to diverse audiences across 6 different geographies </li>\n\t<li>Brand communication: communicating Vymo’s values via different mediums to customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does all of this sound way too exciting for a B2B company? </p>\n\n<p>A B2B Company </p>\n\n<p>That’s because we are NOT a conventional B2B company. Over the last 7 years, we have reinvented every B2B tenet worth revisiting, including and not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enterprise software is not built for user love: our daily adoption is 2.5x average</li>\n\t<li>Cannot close 7 figure deals out of India: we have large customers in 6 countries</li>\n\t<li>B2B marketing is about decks & booths: we make art, films, and craft experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, we don’t consider Design or Creative a support function. We believe Creative is integral to crafting experiences that move people to action. </p>\n\n<p>Because, even B2B companies work with people. </p>\n\n<p>You have to work harder to understand our context. It may not be as simple as understanding why people buy sugary drinks or suits and ties. But, decisions are made by people with flesh and blood, and not insular, inanimate organizations. </p>\n\n<p>Solve higher-order problems. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">Is this right for you? Let’s see... </h2>\n\n<p>We don’t believe we’re right for everyone. We have made enough mistakes to understand what works for us and most importantly, what doesn’t. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re reading this, it’s because your profile reflects the qualities we see in a potential hire. We’re approaching this role purely as an outbound activity.</p>\n\n<p>You must necessarily have,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>6-10 years of experience</b> leading Creative teams </li>\n\t<li><b>strong design fundamentals</b> across mediums </li>\n\t<li><b>built teams, processes, and brands</b> from scratch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If that’s not you, then we apologize for wasting your time. 🙏🏽</p>\n\n<p>Also, we need someone with a strong perspective, but you must marry that with the necessary curiosity and humility to discover our brand and do what’s right for us. We don’t want you transposing what you’ve done before in our context.</p>\n\n<p>Further, you must want to,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>really understand our product and market, even the “boring” bits </li>\n\t<li>be a manager and coach and set the north star for our people </li>\n\t<li>commit to a five year journey from hereon to IPO and beyond </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are not in that mindspace right now then this won’t work out.</p>\n\n<p>You can’t want this passively. It will have to consume you.</p>\n\n<p>You will be spending a significant portion of your waking hours thinking about our mission. You will have to obsess about what we can do better each day.</p>\n\n<p>We understand that this kind of commitment doesn’t happen overnight, but you must be willing to invest in the process at least. Because, we will. 100%.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">The Hiring Process: ~2 weeks </h2>\n\n<p><b>Culture Fit / Are we right for each other?</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1:1 30 min open ended chat with VP-Marketing </li>\n\t<li>Purpose is to understand each others’ aspirations, and  </li>\n\t<li>If we have the right vibe together </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Copy Aesthetics & Fundamentals - I</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Assignment to solve for a copy problem</li>\n\t<li>Benchmarks of what you think is amazing </li>\n\t<li>How it could be relevant for Vymo today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Content Aesthetics & Fundamentals - II</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Post assignment discussion with the team</li>\n\t<li>Educate us about your thought process </li>\n\t<li>How will this fit in our scheme of things</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Coaching & Enablement </b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1:1 60 min discussion with managers </li>\n\t<li>How will you enable our team to be 10x better</li>\n\t<li>How do you see our future evolving</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Culture Fit / How will we work together</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>30 min with the Marketing team @ Vymo</li>\n\t<li>How will your next 30 - 60 - 90 days look </li>\n\t<li>What do you need to be truly successful</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">Why join Vymo?

Why do you want to do this?\n\n\n\n● Customer profiling (15 mins)\n\n○ What are 3 different types of ideal customer profile (ICP) for UrbanPiper (be specific in your\n\ncriteria)?\n\n○ How does our value proposition to them differ?\n\n○ Conduct an interview with 3 restaurateurs, ideally with each one representing one of the ICP’s\n\nyou’ve identified.
