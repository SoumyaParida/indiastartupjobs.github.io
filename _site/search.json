      "content": "<h2 class=\"section-heading\">ABOUT THE TEAM & ROLE:</h2>\n<p>The Marketplace Fulfilment Platform (MFP) team consists of Swiggy’s Core Logistics/Delivery, driver experience and CRM stacks. The charter of this team is to build a multi-tenant delivery platform that can seamlessly onboard multiple different businesses. The platform would need to maximise fleet efficiency across the various businesses. Additionally, the platform would allow third party Driver firms to onboard, while maintaining capacity across the various fleets, determine pSLA promises and assignment across various multi-modal fleets and support pluggable inclusion and exclusion rules to allow matching of orders to drivers. </p>\n\n<p>The Driver Lifecycle Management (DLM) team is responsible for the solutions that meet the needs of the lakhs of driver partners that Swiggy has, including onboarding of drivers, contextual training, profiling, attrition prediction and intervention, governance modules, profiling and tiering and the base platforms for aggregation of signals, nudges to drivers to drive the right behaviors and low latency assistance flows to help the driver deal with exceptional scenarios that they may face in the order journey. The solutions created by the DLM team also need to be multi-tenant to support multiple business lines in Swiggy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">The driver experience team builds solutions across multiple domains including</h2>\n\n<p><b>Sourcing and onboarding, Delivery Partner Entity and Lifecycle management</b> for our delivery partners to deliver a great DX while making sure, no one is able to abuse our platforms. </p>\n\n<p><b>Contextual Training and Performance management platform</b> to help our delivery partners grow in their roles by nudging them in real time on what should / shouldn’t be done, which directly or indirectly affects their earnings. This platform also enables us to rollout gamification / experiments to keep DE’s engaged and help reduce DE attrition.</p>\n\n<p><b>Profiling / Tiering platform</b> will build delivery partner segmentation across multiple attributes like tenure, rating, churn predictions, area familiarity, customer experience delivered, propensity to defraud / abuse the platform and more. Multiple products across Swiggy like Assignments, Mobilisation, Payouts will leverage these signals to solve complicated problems like what DEs to assign to a priority customer or to a customer who is on the verge of churning from the platform, what / how many de’s to mobilise across zones factoring in the conversion by segment, DE’s delivering a great customer experience are rewarded over and above, and more.  </p>\n\n<p><b>Governance platform</b> to monitor all interactions between the DE and the customer, restaurant and Swiggy and act on the DEs basis rules configured either on some real time signals like abuse reported by a customer or aggregated data over time like x post pickup cancellations over a week. The actions taken can range from notifying the DEs on potential actions that can be taken to imposing monetary penalties to terminating them from the platform. Another challenge in this problem domain is to solve for attribution that is to reduce the false positives while providing strong redressal mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p><b>Assistance platform</b> for our delivery partners to get their queries resolved in real time, enabling our delivery partners to deliver a great customer experience.</p>\n\n<p><b>Forecasting and Mobilization</b> We take in demand (number of orders) predictions for a city, zone, time slot and build products to mobilize (delivery partner) supply on the ground. These include products that solve for long term mobilization (Hiring, Hiring Freeze), medium term mobilization (Slot Signup, Slot Tracker, Slot Compliance) and immediate mobilization (Dynamic Surges, Rain Surges, Nudges/Communication). Under supply and over supply are both equally bad for our business and hence the challenge here is accuracy and how quickly are we able to react to on ground situations (delta in demand and supply).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">What qualities are we looking for?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Technically hands-on, with deep dive expertise in designing and developing real-time internet applications or high scale SAAS applications. </li>\n\t<li>6-10 years of experience in developing products with at least a couple of years in leading a charter.</li>\n\t<li>Excellent command over Data Structures and Algorithms. </li>\n\t<li>Exceptional coding skills in an object-oriented programming language (Java/ROR/Golang) </li>\n\t<li>Strong problem solving and analytical skills. </li>\n\t<li>Experience with web technologies Java/ Golang/Python, Linux, Apache, MYSQL, Memcache, Redis, Kafka, AWS etc</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">What will you get to do here?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Coming up with the best practices to help the team achieve their technical tasks and continually thrive in improving the technology of the product/team. </li>\n\t<li>Driving the adoption of best practices & regular participation in code reviews, design reviews, and architecture discussions. </li>\n\t<li>Experiment with new & relevant technologies and tools, and drive adoption while measuring yourself on the impact you can create. </li>\n\t<li>Implementation of long-term technology vision for your team. </li>\n\t<li>Responsible for the complete architecture of your product. </li>\n\t<li>Creating architectures & designs for new solutions around existing/new areas. </li>\n\t<li>Decide technology & tool choices for your team & be responsible for them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">Visit our tech blogs to learn more about some the challenges we deal with:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>https://bytes.swiggy.com/engineering-challenges-at-swiggy-430dea6c86a3</li>\n\t<li>https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-swiggy-delivery-challenge-part-one-6a2abb4f82f6</li>\n\t<li>https://bytes.swiggy.com/what-serviceability-means-at-swiggy-c94c1aad352a</li>\n\t<li>https://bytes.swiggy.com/architecture-and-design-principles-behind-the-swiggys-delivery-partners-app-4db1d87a048a</li>\n\t<li>https://bytes.swiggy.com/swiggy-distance-service-9868dcf613f4</li>\n\t<li>https://bytes.swiggy.com/the-tech-that-brings-you-your-food-1a7926229886</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, sex, disability status, or any other characteristic protected by the law.</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://careers.swiggy.com/#/careers?src%3Dcareers=&career_page_category%3DTechnology%26p%3DeyJwYWdlVHlwZSI6ImpkIiwiY3ZTb3VyY2UiOiJjYXJlZXJzIiwicmVxSWQiOjczNTksInJlcXVlc3RlciI6eyJpZCI6IiIsImNvZGUiOiIiLCJuYW1lIjoiIn0sInBhZ2UiOiJjYXJlZXJzIiwiYnVmaWx0ZXIiOi0xLCJjdXN0b21GaWVsZHMiOnsiY2FyZWVyX3BhZ2VfY2F0ZWdvcnkiOiJUZWNobm9sb2d5In19=\" class=\"pricing-button\">Apply</a>\n"

It’s either a HELL YES or a no from us. ++ You can expect cakes and cookies in the mail.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">About the role: Head of Creative - Brand Design</h2>\n\n<p>The ‘Head of Creative’ role was conceived to help us engage with prospects and customers more meaningfully across mediums.</p>\n\n<p>It will generally involve working with designers, animators, copywriters, and growth marketers to solve a stated problem like, </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>How can we accelerate sales opportunities</b> (they need us, they love us, but how can we get them off their behinds to use us)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How can we increase adoption for Vymo</b> (how can we communicate to people who have always viewed tech with suspicion)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How do we increase conversions on campaigns</b> (are we saying the right things well enough to move CXOs to action)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How can we hire the best engineers</b> (inspiring love for the kind of work we do and who we are without offering BMW bikes)?</li>\n\t<li><b>How can we fight fatigue and burnout</b> (engaging 300+ people remotely and recreating the visceral energy of the office floor)? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>We believe putting shapes and figures together on a beautiful, compelling interface is the lowest resolution of a design solution, much less a creative one. </p>\n\n<p>We like Alchemy.</p>\n\n<p>That is Part I. </p>\n\n<p>The second, and wholly important part is marshalling the people and resources at your disposal to create this alchemy.</p>\n\n<p>You will have to, </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Work with Growth, Customer Success, HR, and other teams to align their operational requirements into something more strategic. Nobody just needs banners.</li>\n\t<li>Define the vision for your team and help them do the best work of their life. This involves getting rid of ambiguity,  and investing in their growth.</li>\n\t<li>Discover our brand ground up and figure how to best represent us. This will involve actually understanding users, customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Translate our brand values and aesthetics to EVERYTHING. Processes, templates, guidelines, workshops and whatever else is required to make sure we’re pixel perfect.</li>\n\t<li>Help the function evolve from support to strategy. That means defining work proactively for your team and function, building for scale and moving the needle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OK, but what will I build?</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Design language & systems: that can help the team ship high quality work in a predictable way while striving for truly global benchmarks. </li>\n\t<li>Product marketing collateral: decks, docs, web pages, films explaining our value proposition to diverse audiences across 6 different geographies </li>\n\t<li>Brand communication: communicating Vymo’s values via different mediums to customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Does all of this sound way too exciting for a B2B company? </p>\n\n<p>A B2B Company </p>\n\n<p>That’s because we are NOT a conventional B2B company. Over the last 7 years, we have reinvented every B2B tenet worth revisiting, including and not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Enterprise software is not built for user love: our daily adoption is 2.5x average</li>\n\t<li>Cannot close 7 figure deals out of India: we have large customers in 6 countries</li>\n\t<li>B2B marketing is about decks & booths: we make art, films, and craft experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, we don’t consider Design or Creative a support function. We believe Creative is integral to crafting experiences that move people to action. </p>\n\n<p>Because, even B2B companies work with people. </p>\n\n<p>You have to work harder to understand our context. It may not be as simple as understanding why people buy sugary drinks or suits and ties. But, decisions are made by people with flesh and blood, and not insular, inanimate organizations. </p>\n\n<p>Solve higher-order problems. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">Is this right for you? Let’s see... </h2>\n\n<p>We don’t believe we’re right for everyone. We have made enough mistakes to understand what works for us and most importantly, what doesn’t. </p>\n\n<p>If you’re reading this, it’s because your profile reflects the qualities we see in a potential hire. We’re approaching this role purely as an outbound activity.</p>\n\n<p>You must necessarily have,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><b>6-10 years of experience</b> leading Creative teams </li>\n\t<li><b>strong design fundamentals</b> across mediums </li>\n\t<li><b>built teams, processes, and brands</b> from scratch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If that’s not you, then we apologize for wasting your time. 🙏🏽</p>\n\n<p>Also, we need someone with a strong perspective, but you must marry that with the necessary curiosity and humility to discover our brand and do what’s right for us. We don’t want you transposing what you’ve done before in our context.</p>\n\n<p>Further, you must want to,</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>really understand our product and market, even the “boring” bits </li>\n\t<li>be a manager and coach and set the north star for our people </li>\n\t<li>commit to a five year journey from hereon to IPO and beyond </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are not in that mindspace right now then this won’t work out.</p>\n\n<p>You can’t want this passively. It will have to consume you.</p>\n\n<p>You will be spending a significant portion of your waking hours thinking about our mission. You will have to obsess about what we can do better each day.</p>\n\n<p>We understand that this kind of commitment doesn’t happen overnight, but you must be willing to invest in the process at least. Because, we will. 100%.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">The Hiring Process: ~2 weeks </h2>\n\n<p><b>Culture Fit / Are we right for each other?</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1:1 30 min open ended chat with VP-Marketing </li>\n\t<li>Purpose is to understand each others’ aspirations, and  </li>\n\t<li>If we have the right vibe together </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Copy Aesthetics & Fundamentals - I</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Assignment to solve for a copy problem</li>\n\t<li>Benchmarks of what you think is amazing </li>\n\t<li>How it could be relevant for Vymo today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Content Aesthetics & Fundamentals - II</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Post assignment discussion with the team</li>\n\t<li>Educate us about your thought process </li>\n\t<li>How will this fit in our scheme of things</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Coaching & Enablement </b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1:1 60 min discussion with managers </li>\n\t<li>How will you enable our team to be 10x better</li>\n\t<li>How do you see our future evolving</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Culture Fit / How will we work together</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>30 min with the Marketing team @ Vymo</li>\n\t<li>How will your next 30 - 60 - 90 days look </li>\n\t<li>What do you need to be truly successful</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"section-heading\">Why join Vymo?

Why do you want to do this?\n\n\n\n● Customer profiling (15 mins)\n\n○ What are 3 different types of ideal customer profile (ICP) for UrbanPiper (be specific in your\n\ncriteria)?\n\n○ How does our value proposition to them differ?\n\n○ Conduct an interview with 3 restaurateurs, ideally with each one representing one of the ICP’s\n\nyou’ve identified.
