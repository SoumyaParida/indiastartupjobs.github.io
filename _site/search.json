At UrbanPiper, we are\n\nbuilding the leading SAAS platform for the restaurant industry. As Director Sales you will be leading the\n\nbusiness in one of the critical regions in the country, launching and expanding as effectively and\n\nefficiently as possible. We will support you with a robust array of internal experts, tools and other\n\nresources, offering you a significant amount of autonomy to deploy them as you see fit. We now look to\n\nyou to persuade UrbanPiper leadership that you are the right person to lead the initiative.\n\n\n\n● Introduce yourself to the panel with a brief professional journey (5 mins)\n\n○ What is your relevant work experience to date?\n\n○ What have you built/achieved that’s most surprising in it’s combination of creativity + speed of\n\nexecution (we welcome answers that don’t relate to sales)\n\n○ To be successful in this role, it may well require more hard work and dedication than anything\n\nyou’ve done before. Why do you want to do this?\n\n\n\n● Customer profiling (15 mins)\n\n○ What are 3 different types of ideal customer profile (ICP) for UrbanPiper (be specific in your\n\ncriteria)?\n\n○ How does our value proposition to them differ?\n\n○ Conduct an interview with 3 restaurateurs, ideally with each one representing one of the ICP’s\n\nyou’ve identified. What are your insights?\n\n\n\n● Prepare a sales execution plan with no more than 10 slides addressing the following: (15 mins)\n\n○ Go-to-market strategy\n\n○ The sales cycle\n\n○ Core narrative\n\n○ UrbanPiper’s competitors along with a competitive benchmarking framework\n\n○ A month-on-month operating plan along with a budget for the next 24 months.\n\n○ Outline the structure of your team as well as team roles & responsibilities\n\n○ Define core sales metrics for each role\n\n○ Call out risks and any other key factors for consideration for achieving our revenue goals\n\n\n\n● Now pitch the UrbanPiper Prime POS to a restaurateur (the panel!) and close the deal! (15 mins)\n\nTask 2 (10 mins): Enlighten us with your biggest passion in life - take any one topic that is closest to your\n\nheart and go deep into it. This could be a hobby, sport, or a social cause you feel the most about.\n\nPlease share the solution with your recruiter in a shareable format using Google Docs, optimized to be\n\npresented to a panel in 1 hour. This exercise is intentionally ambiguous and we suggest that you\n\nexplicitly define your assumptions. The team will review your case study and if successful, invite you to\n\npresent it live.</p>\n\n<a href=\"hhttps://careers.urbanpiper.com/jobs/mrLvNF6MFdQF/india-national-bd-head-sme\" class=\"pricing-button\">Apply</a>\n"

Founded in 2014, we are transforming the sector with our global-first driver relay model made possible through a unique mix of next generation data science and operational excellence. Grounded in the mission of making logistics human, we have fundamentally changed the truck driver’s job from a ‘months-away-from-home’ job to a ‘day’ job. Unlike conventional truck drivers, relay pilots drive from pitstop to pitstop (under 300 kms) and return to their families the same day, thus, creating huge social dividend.</p>\n<p>Relay trucking also ensures 50-70% reduction in turnaround time and highest reliability for clients, helping them reinvent their business models – serving new markets, reducing inventory and significantly cutting costs.
