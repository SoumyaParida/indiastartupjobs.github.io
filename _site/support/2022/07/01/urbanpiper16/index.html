Case Study Brief: Director Sales (SME)



Task 1: Food services is a $60 billion market growing at 10% annually in India. At UrbanPiper, we are

building the leading SAAS platform for the restaurant industry. As Director Sales you will be leading the

business in one of the critical regions in the country, launching and expanding as effectively and

efficiently as possible. We will support you with a robust array of internal experts, tools and other

resources, offering you a significant amount of autonomy to deploy them as you see fit. We now look to

you to persuade UrbanPiper leadership that you are the right person to lead the initiative.



● Introduce yourself to the panel with a brief professional journey (5 mins)

○ What is your relevant work experience to date?

○ What have you built/achieved that’s most surprising in it’s combination of creativity + speed of

execution (we welcome answers that don’t relate to sales)

○ To be successful in this role, it may well require more hard work and dedication than anything

you’ve done before. Why do you want to do this?



● Customer profiling (15 mins)

○ What are 3 different types of ideal customer profile (ICP) for UrbanPiper (be specific in your

criteria)?

○ How does our value proposition to them differ?

○ Conduct an interview with 3 restaurateurs, ideally with each one representing one of the ICP’s

you’ve identified. What are your insights?



● Prepare a sales execution plan with no more than 10 slides addressing the following: (15 mins)

○ Go-to-market strategy

○ The sales cycle

○ Core narrative

○ UrbanPiper’s competitors along with a competitive benchmarking framework

○ A month-on-month operating plan along with a budget for the next 24 months.

○ Outline the structure of your team as well as team roles & responsibilities

○ Define core sales metrics for each role

○ Call out risks and any other key factors for consideration for achieving our revenue goals



● Now pitch the UrbanPiper Prime POS to a restaurateur (the panel!) and close the deal! (15 mins)

Task 2 (10 mins): Enlighten us with your biggest passion in life - take any one topic that is closest to your

heart and go deep into it. This could be a hobby, sport, or a social cause you feel the most about.

Please share the solution with your recruiter in a shareable format using Google Docs, optimized to be

presented to a panel in 1 hour. This exercise is intentionally ambiguous and we suggest that you

explicitly define your assumptions. The team will review your case study and if successful, invite you to

present it live.</p>
