			<p>Vymo (https://www.getvymo.com) is one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in the world with the mission to help sales teams #DoMore. It’s a mobile-first Personal Sales Assistant -  a first of its kind - that automatically captures sales activities and predicts ‘next best actions’ contextually by learning from top sales reps. Headquartered in San Francisco, the company houses over 200+ people across seven offices globally. </p>

<p>Vymo is the distribution excellence cloud trusted by over 125,000users across 60+ leading enterprises such as AXA, Allianz, Generali, AIA, and more. A Gartner ‘Cool Vendor’, Vymo is funded by Emergence Capital & Sequoia Capital. The company has seen 3x YoY growth over the last few years and aspires to do even better this year by building up a truly global and diverse team.</p>

<p>What is the Personal Sales Assistant - A game-changer! </p>

<p>We thrive in the CRM space where every company struggles to deliver meaningful engagement & contextual analytics to their Sales teams.

With its powerful intelligence engine, the platform captures sales activities automatically and learns how to make Sales Representatives more productive through nudges and suggestions on a mobile device. That’s why over 85% of salespeople use Vymo daily. Watch Vymo in action - https://youtu.be/9saePnvir4M</p></
